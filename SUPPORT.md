# Getting Support

For questions (e.g., both quick questions and those requiring examples) please email
[Start Your Lab Support](mailto:support@startyourlab.com). [NOTE: please update this to one
of your own lab members.]

To report issues, use this repository's issue tracker.

**DO NOT** use the issue tracker to ask questions; use email for
that. Questions posed to the issue tracker will be closed.

When reporting an issue, you are expected to include details, such as:

- A narrative description of what you are trying to accomplish.
- The minimum code necessary to reproduce the issue.
- The expected results of exercising that code.
- The actual results received.

We may ask for additional details if the issue cannot be reproduced or understood
by the initial description.

You may also submit a failing test case as a pull request.
